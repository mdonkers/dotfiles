# If not using a login (display) manager, you might want to create
# the ~/.xsession file and move below contents there to start a specific
# Window Manager.
# Priority is as follows:
# - Run session as provided by Display Manager
# - Run "~/.xsession" or "~/.Xsession" and start Window Manager from there
# - Run "/usr/bin/x-window-manager", which can be configured via "update-alternatives --config x-window-manager"

# See also "man i3", start i3 Window Manager directly from "~/.xsession"
# exec i3 -V >> ~/.i3/logfile 2>&1
