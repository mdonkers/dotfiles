# Install Debian on Dell XPS 15 #

This manual assumes (at least) the following versions:
- Dell XPS 15 - 9560 model from 2017 - BIOS version 1.3.4
- Debian Stretch 9.1.0 (with upgrade to Buster / Testing)

## Preparations ##

### Download Debian distro and create bootable USB ###
Download the Debian net-installer ISO. Make sure to get the *non-free including firmware* ISO from
the link above, because we need the non-free drivers for the WiFi. Pick stable (Stretch) because testing
often gives issues during install. We'll upgrade later.
The following steps assume a *nix environment.

Insert the USB drive and check which device is added. Either via `dmesg` or checking `/dev/...`.
Under Linux this will presumably be `/dev/sdb`, under MacOS `/dev/disk2`.

The images can be simply copied to the device:

    cp debian-<version>.iso /dev/sdb
    sync

Remove the USB stick again (under MacOS using `diskutil eject /dev/disk2`).


### Resize current partition ###
Open the Windows Disk Util to update the partitions.

Decrease the size for the Windows partition to make space available for Debian. You will approx need the following free room
- 100 Gb for Debian
- 1x the size of your RAM for SWAP (32 Gb RAM -> 32 Gb SWAP)


### Setup Safe Mode ###
Login into Windows 10, and set up Safe Mode: "Change advanced Startup Options" -> "Restart Now"
  -> "Troubleshoot" -> "Advanced options" -> "Startup Settings" -> "Restart"

Disable "Fast Boot" in the "Power Options" menu, look for "Turn on fast startup"

Now reboot to get into the BIOS menu.


## UEFI Boot Settings ##
Some UEFI settings and other BIOS parameters need to be configured to work correctly with Linux.
Change the following settings by pressing F2 repeatedly when booting:

- Change the SATA Mode from the default "RAID" to "AHCI". This will allow Linux to detect the NVME SSD.
- Change Fastboot to "Thorough" in "POST Behaviour". This prevents intermittent boot failures.
- Disable secure boot to allow Linux to boot.

Save and restart. Initially Windows will not boot, but after some time will get into the Recovery Mode again. Navigate to
"Troubleshoot" -> "Advanced options" -> "Startup Settings" -> "Restart" -- Then after restarting choose "F4 - Safe Mode".

When in Windows, check the "IDE ATA/ATAPI controller" is "Intel(R) 100 Series/C230 Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller", via "Start" -> "Windows System" -> "Control Panel" -> "Device Manager". Restart.


## Install Debian ##
Shutdown the laptop and insert the USB with Debian installer. Startup, repeatedly pressing F12 for the one-time boot menu.

Boot the Debian installer, easiest is to opt for the graphical installer. The installer might ask to search for the WiFi firmware,
just selecting _No_ should make it fetch from the non-free firmware included.

Create at least the SWAP and EXT4 partition.
Finish the installation.


## Setup Debian ##
Some quick setup to make our live easier with further setup and configuration.

Get a bigger font-size in the console

    dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

Choose font `Terminus` with size `14x28`.

Install git to fetch our `dotfiles` repository

    apt-get install --no-install-recommends git

Fetch the dotfiles repo

    git clone git://github.com/mdonkers/dotfiles.git "/tmp/dotfiles"


## Dist upgrade to Stretch ##
We need to do the dist-upgrade because for some reason 'Stretch' won't install directly. Hopefully at some point not needed anymore.
Check the status of packages, you should see no warnings or either fix them

    dpkg --audit

Run the following commands to do the upgrade:

    cd /tmp/dotfiles/bin
    install.sh dist

Because the kernel is upgraded, GRUB also needs to be updated to boot the correct stuff. Re-run the `mount` and `grub-install` steps to fix GRUB before rebooting.

Now you're ready to reboot! Cross your fingers...


## Continue Debian configuration ##
Now we can start installing tools to make the MacBook work as intended. First we'll install them and then setup one by one.
(might need to fetch the `dotfiles` repo again)

    cd /tmp/dotfiles
    bin/install.sh sources
    bin/install.sh wifi other
    bin/install.sh graphics nvidia
    bin/install.sh wm

As user, **not as root** !

    bin/install.sh dotfiles
    bin/install.sh syncthing
    bin/install.sh keybase

After Syncthing is installed, enable / start the syncthing service and set it up.

Verify wlan is working

    iwconfig

To install Slack, first download the Debian package. Then the following commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo dpkg -i path/to/deb/file
    sudo apt-get install -f

To install IntelliJ, download the package and extract. Move to the following location:

    /usr/local/share/idea-IU-<version>

Install the desktop shortcut by starting IntelliJ and from the _Configure_ menu select _Create Desktop Entry_.
This will put a `.desktop` entry in `~/.local/share/applications/jetbrains-idea.desktop`.
Install global desktop shortcuts to the following location (optional):

    /usr/share/applications/

To fix keyboard input problems caused by IBus, update the `Exec` command and prefix with: `env XMODIFIERS= `.

Cleanup

    bin/install.sh cleanup

## S.M.A.R.T. monitoring for NVMe drives
Smartmon tools / smartd might be failing because the Dell XPS is using a NVMe drive which is still in experimentel support.

Check with `systemctl status smartd.service`.
If failing, update `/etc/smartd.conf` and add the parameter `-d nvme` to the `DEVICESCAN` line.
Restart with `sudo systemctl restart smartd.service` and check again.




## High kworker CPU usage & Suspending

After all setup is done, check CPU usage with `top`. If `kworker` shows high usage,
typically > 70%, something might be wrong with ACPI interrupts. To check, execute:

    grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/

If one of the interrupts stands out and has high interrupts, it can be disabled (as root):

    echo disable > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpeXX

Permanently (as root):

    crontab -e
    @reboot echo "disable" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe[XX]

Before and after, check there are no errors using `dmesg`.

Also if suspend is not working correctly, this might be due to the bluetooth driver triggering
a wakeup. First check wich devices may trigger a wakeup:

    cat /proc/acpi/wakeup

If anything else besides `LID0` is `*enabled` this might prevent sleeping. Temporarily disable (as root):

    echo XHC1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup

Permanently (as root):

    crontab -e
    @reboot echo "XHC1" > /proc/acpi/wakeup

## Repair GRUB

### Grub Rescue Mode
When you enter Grub Rescue Mode after (or during) Windows updates, it might be that partitions changed. Use the following
steps to get a working bootloader again.

See which partition is currently being used to boot from (look for the `prefix=(hd0,...)/boot/grub`)

    set

See which partitions there are and use this to find the 'new' boot partition:

    ls
    ls (hd0,gpt5)/boot/

Set the new boot partition:

    set prefix=(hd0,...)/boot/grub
    insmod normal
    normal

Now you should be able to boot into Windows to continue updates, or boot to Debian again. From Debian, do
a `sudo grub-install` to install Grub again into the correct partition.

### Grub disabled / corrupted
If GRUB becomes disabled / corrupt because of Windows updates, this can be repaired with the Debian install disk.

- Boot the install disk from USB.
- Choose "Advanced setup"
- Repair GRUB -> enter disk `/dev/nvme0n1`

If this fails, the `debian` entry in the EFI boot sector might have become corrupted. Follow these steps:

- Boot into Windows
- Open a Powershell with Admin rights
- Run the following commands:

    diskpart
    sel disk 0
    list vol

- Pick the EFI partition, probably the only one with FAT32 filesystem:

    sel vol <number of volume>
    assign letter=z:
    exit

- Now run `chkdsk` to repair the Debian directory:

    chkdsk z:\EFI\debian /R

- This should confert the directory to a file. Remove the file `del debian`
- Exit, and follow the steps at the top of this section to reinstall GRUB


## Misc stuff

Use `arandr` as graphical interface to `xrandr` to configure the screen resolution. A resolution of 1440x900 works for me (1680x1050 if you like small fonts).

## Mounting

To mount e.g. USB devices, first connect the device and get the UUID for mounting:

    sudo mkdir -p /media/usb
    sudo fstab -l
    ll /dev/disk/by-uuid/

Having the correct UUID, add the following line to `/etc/fstab`

    UUID=<ID...>  /media/usb	vfat defaults,noauto,users,noatime,nodiratime,dmask=0022,fmask=0133 0 0

Then simply mount the device with `mount /media/usb`


## HP Printer installation
Follow guidelines here: http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/install/manual/distros/debian.html


## Use of FN-key
With the Dell keyboard its easy to switch between FN-key behaviour. Simply press Fn+Esc

To find keycodes for any key pressed, use the following command (the second prints the full keymap):

    xev | sed -n 's/^.*keycode *\([0-9]\+\).*$/keycode \1 = /p'
    xmodmap -pke


## Special characters
Special characters can be typed in two ways, with the 'compose' key or by typing the unicode character.
To set the 'compose' key to Right-Alt / AltGr, first check if it is available, then do the mapping:

    grep "compose:" /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
    setxkbmap -option compose:ralt

Typing characters with the compose key works e.g. by `compose+", e` which results in Ã«.
Unicode characters can also be entered directly using the combination; `ctrl+shift+u` followed by
the numeric code of the character.


## Cleanup unused wifi connections
Cleanup unused connections in:

    /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections


## Connect to WiFi via cli
Using the `nmcli` tool it's also possible to connect instead of using the applet.
Here are the relevant commands.

See list of all WiFi networks and the currently connected network:

    nmcli dev wifi list

Add new connection:

    nmcli connection add con-name <Name> ifname wlan0 type wifi ssid <SSID_Name> wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk wifi-sec.psk <Password>

See list of all locally know connections:

    nmcli connection show

Connect to a network:

    nmcli connection up <Name>


## Some useful key commands

- Switch between terminals:                 ALT+F1/F6
- Switch between terminals from X:          CTRL+ALT+F1/F6
- Scroll up/down:                           FN+SHIFT+UP/DOWN
- Copy/paste from application:              CTRL+C/V
- Copy/paste from RXVT Terminal:            CTRL+ALT+C/V


## Disabled Speedstep

For some reason the XPS might jump into some kind of "safe" mode where all cores are locked to 800 MHz.
The machine feels a bit slow and the CPU temp never gets above 50 C (no fans spinning). To double check use
this command:

    watch grep \"cpu MHz\" /proc/cpuinfo

Speedstep can be enabled again by disconnecting the battery. For more information, see here;
